## Writeups

### READ: Upgrade Your Tech Skills With Deliberate Practice


### WATCH: Carol Dweck On The Growth Mindset
#### https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve/up-next?language=en

My big takeaway from this video and speech by Carl Dweck is that focusing on instant results and the **_now_** leads to a fixed mindset where a person is expecting immediate results, and if those results are subpar or failing, then the person may feel slighted, or inadequate in some way.

Instead, focusing on the process of success, or the **_yet_** can lead to more tenacious people who are willing to accept and learn from their failures and shortcomings in order to push forward and achieve greater success.

### WATCH: Angela Lee Duckworth On Grit
#### https://www.ted.com/talks/angela_lee_duckworth_grit_the_power_of_passion_and_perseverance/up-next

The message I received from this video what that the concept of **_grit_** (or tenacity / persistance / perserverance) is the largest contributing factor to long-term success. This ties in to the idea of having a growth mindset because it's that long-term vision, and the passion and persistance (or grit) to stumble, fail, and climb your way to your goals through all difficulties and obstacles.

### WATCH: Alain de Botton On Redefining Success
#### https://www.ted.com/talks/alain_de_botton_a_kinder_gentler_philosophy_of_success/up-next

There were a couple things that I took away from this video:

- The first being that judging others based upon their career is exactly the old adage of judging a book by the cover. The story might be great, but you'll never know if you don't bother to read it.

- The second being the concept of losing vs being a loser. People can lose, or fail, or stumble, but it doesn't define their whole being, it's just a focal point of one particular instance of their life.

- The last was about success, and understanding that to be successful at something you have to accept the trade-off that you will be taking away from something else that is in some way related, as in the example of a work-life balance. If you put all of your time into being successful at work, you're probably not left with as much time to be successful at home.

### LISTEN: The Drs. Sarah On Imposter Syndrome (Parts 1 and 2)

### READ: How To Think Like A Programmer
#### https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-think-like-a-programmer-lessons-in-problem-solving-d1d8bf1de7d2/

Programming and coding is all about problem-solving, and thinking like a programmer is all about obtaining and holding on to the mindset of problem-solving. The key step to this is having a framework to work through problems. A common framework structure that the article covered reminded me a lot of how we whiteboard, consisting of three to four steps: Understand, Plan, Divide, and if you're stuck then Debug.

### READ: Pretend Your Time Is Worth $1,000/HR
#### https://medium.com/swlh/pretend-your-time-is-worth-1-000-hour-and-youll-become-100x-more-productive-f04628bb3e6d

The big takeaway I recieved from this article was that having a clear set of goals, and making sure that those tasks and accomplishments are prioritized is key. Doing things just to do them can distract and deter you from those goals, and also projects that you are not as dedicated towards your mission in the eyes of others.

### READ: What I Wish I Knew Before I Learned To Code
#### https://medium.com/coding-in-simple-english/what-i-wish-i-knew-before-i-learned-to-code-8edcadbd2dcd

This article really hammered home that learning to code is not the same for any two (or more) people. Everyone learns different, and everyone has different methods and paths that lead to successful learning for them. A key takeway for me was that if I'm struggling to understand something, ask questions. Do my research, and if I need to then ask questions on my research as well. Find my specific learning style or path and follow it to the best of my ability.
